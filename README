=====================================================================
Zeo++ is a software package for high-throughput analysis of structure 
and topology of crystalline porous materials. For a given material's 
structure, the code calculates the geometrical parameters describing 
pores. The tool is based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for 
a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph 
representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network 
is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere 
and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters 
that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility 
of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule 
and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality 
of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible 
surfaces, volumes and pore size distributions.
The code also offers some aids with structure analysis, e.g. MOF open 
metal site detection, and simluations, e.g. generation of blocking spheres. 


Compilation - Linux / Mac OS / Windows with Cygwin
=====================================================================
The code is written in ANSI C++, and compiles on many system architectures. The
package contains the C++ source code of Zeo++ as well as Voro++ library.
On Linux, Mac OS, and Windows (using Cygwin), the compilation and installed 
can be carried out using GNU Make.


*** Step by step compilation ***

1) Unpack the provided Zeo++ package (the following commands will create 
   zeo++-0.3.0 directory containing the Zeo++ code; Voro++ library 
   will be placed in one of subfolders (zeo++-0.3.0/voro++)):

  gunzip zeo++-0.3.0.tar.gz
  tar xvf zeo++-0.3.0.tar


2) Compile Voro++ library (you may need first to review config.mk file in 
   zeo++-0.3.0/voro++/ directory; please check Voro++ documentation or
   read zeo++-0.3.0/voro++/README):

  cd zeo++-0.3.0/voro++/src
  make


3) Compile Zeo++ code:

  cd ../..
  make


4) Step (3) will create "network" binary inside zeo++-0.3.0. This is the main
   Zeo++ binary. Please view the Zeo++ website for instructions, review 
   zeo++-0.3.0/documentation/README or contact the authors to inquire about 
   otherwise undocumented or custom features.


Related programs
=====================================================================
No external dependencies are required to compile and run the code 
(except for the Voro++ library provided with the code), but several
programs may be useful for analyzing the output:

- VMD - molecular visualization package can be used to visualize some of
  characteristics calculated by Zeo++, for example, Voronoi networks, 
  Monte Carlo-sampled surface areas and volumes etc. Zeo++ can be called
  from within VMD vis TCl ZeoVis interface (not yet documented, if interested, 
  please contact me at mharanczyk@lbl.gov) 

- The freeware raytracer POV-Ray (available at www.povray.org) can be used for
  high-quality renderings of the Zeo++/VMD outputs.

- VisIt - powerful visualization package; https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/

The first reference is the main Zeo++ reference describing the idea of 
using Voronoi networks in analysis of porous materials. The second reference 
describes extensions allowing sampling of structures from a database of 
porous materials using divrsity-based selelction.
