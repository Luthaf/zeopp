./network [-cssr [outputfile_cssr]] 
	  [-v1 [outputfile_v1]] 
	  [-xyz [outputfile_xyz]] 
	  [-nt2 [outputfile_nt2]]
          [-res [outputfile_res]] 
	  [-zvis [outputfile_zvis]] 
	  [-axs probe_radius [outputfile_axs]]

          [-block probe_radius num_samples [outputfile_sa]]
          [-psd chan_radius probe_radius num_samples [outputfile_vol]]
	  [-chan probe_radius [outputfile_chan]] 
	  [-r [radfile]] 
	  INPUTFILE

Note: For all of the program features that have an optional outputfile, the output is written to the filename when it is provided. Otherwise,
the output is  written to ($file_prefix).($feature_name). For instance, if the provided file is ABW.cuc and -cssr is specified w/o any output file,
the resulting input will be written by default to ABW.cssr

-cssr [outputfile_cssr] : Output a .cssr representation of the input file. 

-v1   [outputfile_v1]   : Output a .v1   representation of the input file.  

-xyz  [outputfile_xyz]  : Output a .xyz  representation of the input file.   

-nt2  [outputfile_nt2]  : Output a .nt2  representation of the Voronoi network for the given unit cell.   

-r    [radfile] : Use radii while performing the Vornoi decomposition. If no .rad file is provided,
   	          default radii contained within the program are used, if possible. If a .rad 
	          file is provided, the default radii are overriden. The .rad file consists of 
		  two columns, containing the atomic types and radii respectively. For an example
		  file, please refer to example.rad.
		  If no -r option is specified, all of the atoms are treated as having a radius of 0.
		  
-mass massfile : Replace the built-in mass table with that provided in a .mass file. The .mass file consists
      	       	 of two columns, containing the atomic types and masses respectively. For an example file,
		 please refer to example.mass


-res  [outputfile_res] : Output the maximum free sphere results to the provided file.  
      		       	 Format is: maxIncDiam maxDiam incDiam 
	       	       	 where  maxIncDiam is the maximum included sphere diameter, maxDiam is the maximum free sphere diameter, incDiam is the maximum included diameters for the maximum free sphere path.

-zvis [outputfile_zvis] : Output a file used by ZeoVis to depict important features about the atomic network and Voronoi network.

-axs probe_radius [outputfile_axs] : Outputs a file with N lines, where N = # of Voronoi nodes.  
     		  		     Each line is true or false, representing the accessibility of the ith Voronoi node.

-sa chan_radius probe_radius num_samples_per_atom  [outputfile_sa]  : Determine the amount of accessible surface area. The accessibility of nodes is determined
    			     		 		     	      using $chan_radius, and probe-atom overlap is determiend using $probe_radius. A total of
							     	      $num_samples_per_atom points are sampled at a distance of $probe_radius from each atom and Monte
							     	      Carlo integration is used to determine the final result.  

-vol chan_radius probe_radius num_samples [outputfile_sa]  : Determine the amount of accessible volume. The accessibility of nodes is determined
    			     		 		     using $chan_radius, and probe-atom overlap is determined using $probe_radius. A total of
							     $num_samples points are sampled across the unit cell and Monte Carlo integration is used
							     to determine the final result. 

-sub [outputfile_sub]        : Attempt to replace every other Si atom within the network with an Al atom consistently.
     			       If successful, write the resulting network to a .cssr file. No output is written if the substitution fails. 
     			      

-fsub frac [outputfile_fsub] : Attempt to randomly replace $frac of Si atoms within the network with an Al atom consistently. The specified fraction must not exceed 0.5.
      	   		       If successful, write the resulting network to a .cssr file. No output is written if the substitution fails. 

-chan probe_radius  [outputfile_chan]      : Determine the channels available to a probe of size $probe_radius. 
      		  	       	  	     Outputs a file used by ZeoVis to draw the resulting channels.

INPUTFILE    : Must be in the .cuc, .cssr or .v1 file format.
